                A welcoming homepage with a visually appealing hero section that
                highlights key pages like Services, Booking, and Login, along

                The Review Section allows users to leave feedback and rate the
                site with a 1-5 star rating system. A text area is provided for
                writing reviews. Once a review is submitted, the average site
                rating is displayed along with the last two user reviews (rating
                + feedback). A "See All Reviews" button redirects to a page with
                all reviews.If the user is not logged in, a black overlay with a
                "Login" button is displayed above the review section. Clicking
                the button redirects them to the login page. After logging in,
                the user is redirected to the homepage. If the user is already

              <li>
                Users can sign up and will automatically be assigned the "USER"
                role by default. Initially, there will be an admin in the
                database, and this admin will have the ability to promote other
                users to the "ADMIN" role when necessary. The system allows
                users to create new accounts with a simple and secure
                registration process. It also includes form validation to ensure
                that all required fields are correctly filled out. After the
                registration attempt, the system will display appropriate
                success or error messages based on whether the process was
                completed successfully or if any issues occurred.
              </li>
              <li>
                Users can log in by entering their email and password, and the
                system will use token-based authentication to verify their
                identity. If there are any issues with the login process, such
                as incorrect credentials or other errors, the system will
                provide clear and helpful error messages to guide the user in
                resolving the issue. This ensures a smooth and secure login
                experience.

                services, filter them based on criteria such as price or
                duration, and sort them to find the options that best suit their
                needs. This helps users quickly find the right service based on

                The service details page provides complete information about the
                selected service, including its features and available time
                slots. By default, the page displays the time slots for the
                current date, making it easy for users to see the options right
                away. Time slots that are already booked will be disabled and
                unclickable to prevent any confusion, while available slots will
                remain clickable, allowing users to choose their preferred time.
                Additionally, users can use an optional calendar feature to
                select a different date, and the time slots available for that
                specific date will be displayed. Once a time slot is selected, a
                "Book This Service" button will appear, enabling users to
                confirm their booking quickly and easily.

              <li>
                On the Left Side, users will see an overview of the selected
                service and time slot presented in an attractive and visually
                appealing design. This section provides a quick summary of their
                choice, ensuring clarity before proceeding with the booking
                process.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the Right Side, there is a form for users to fill in their
                personal information, such as name and email, with the selected
                time slot automatically filled in for convenience. This section
                also features a "Pay Now" button for seamless payment
                processing.
              </li>

                When the "Pay Now" button is clicked, the user is redirected to
                the secure AAMARPAY payment gateway to complete the transaction.
                Once the payment is successful, the system automatically updates
                the selected time slotâ€™s status to "booked" to prevent double
                bookings. Finally, the user is redirected to a success page,

                details.

                slot will be shown in the navbar, ensuring they are always aware
                of their most urgent appointment. Additionally, in the "Upcoming

                countdown timer, helping users stay on top of all their upcoming
